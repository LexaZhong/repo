| Changes                       | Details                                                |
|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| People like the story about bob, but it is not clear enough | I gave up on the story of Bob since it seems a bit redundant for it is repeating the information.|
| The ideas of the visualization worked well, but still need to modify some details | I will do this in the end, when I finish building my website and inserting all the background images, to make sure that the colors is consistent. |
| NIL deals itself is straightforward, but I should provide more information for those who are interested in how it is legalized and how it works with state-level regulations. | I added in a walk-through of the important events in the history of NIL deals. Also included a link to a more detailed website about the NIL Deals|
| No data visualization in the 60s story | Since I gave up the original framework of the story, I included visualizitions in the 60s story. |


## The audience
The audience are people who are interested in sports. This website might more readable for people who have some background knowledge about NCAA. 


## Final design decisions 

- **COLOR:** I chose blue to be the main color of the back ground, red and white for text and graphs. Blue stands for NCAA and red helps the important content to stand out. 
- **TEMPLATES:** I referenced a lot of sample work and templates on shorthand to achieve my ideal results. At first, I was too distracted and overwhelmed by the cool effects and was a bit lost. At last, I chose the simplest templates to display the content.
- **GRAPHS:** I struggled a lot on which tool to choose. Due to I have a relatively large dataset and rawgraph and datawrapper cannot handle it, I did the visualization on Tableau and Fourish. I like really like the animation available on Fourish.
- **STYLE:** My final style is a bit like a modern poster, integrating some comic elements. I think the topic should be interesting and fun to learn about, so I picked the light mode, also added cute icons and images.

# Final thoughts
- About Data: The basis of a good visualization is data. Manipulating, tranforming, summing and pivoting the data to make it work better with the visualization tools is a crucial step. For example, datawrapper cannot handle large dataset, so I have to manually filter and sum the data in advance. I took an exploratory data visualization course last semester, so I am able to picture what the data look like before visualization. And doing this project further improves my ability in interpreting and manipulating the data.
- About Aesthetics: I sometimes, or always go to extremes on aesthetics, which can be fun but also time-consuming. I get to play around with lots of cool visualization tools, to explore lots of templates and to learn from other people's creative thoughts. But with all the powerful tool available, it took me some time to find which tool can help me achieve the visualization I have in mind.
- About TSWD: This is a wonderful course. I learned a lot in this mini course. Shout out to Professor Goranson and Katelin!
