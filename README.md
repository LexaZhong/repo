# 1. About me
Hi! My name is Huiru (Lexa) Zhong. I am a CMU student pursuing my master degree in public policy and management - Data analytics.

Looking forward to learning how to tell a good story with data with yall.

## 1) What I hope to learn
### from class
   -  how to choose the right colors
   -  I want to form my own style of data visualization
   -  how to organize multiple graphs and charts to let the story flow
   -  how different types of graphs work together
