# Wireframes / storyboards
## 1. Fictional athlete: Football player Bob (60s story)
College Sports have been more and more popular and lucrative in recent years. 
   - He joined the Sponge state college in 2020 and plays in the NCAA Division one. He is a very talented brought victory to his team, generating millions of dollars for his college.
   - However, none of the revenue he generated goes to his own pocket. People would say, no way, he must have earned huge amount of money from commercials. But he did not. Because under the NCAA regulation, compensation for student athletes is limited to scholarships for their education.
   - He is really annoyed and rushed to the Athlete director's office. But the AD says "Bob, do you know how much your coaching training cost? The revenue is deceiving, there is not much left after deducting all the expenses." "Oh, in addition to that, NCAA wants us to more equally distribute the funds, we probably need to cut the budget for football."
   - Poor Bob. What can he do? Luckily, in his second year in the team, in 2021, NIL deals are legalized in his state, which is considered one of the most significant changes in NCAA's history.. He signed deals with Nike, Gatorade and Benz, all are very lucrative partnerships.


## 2. Overview:
> Viz: 1) Total revenue increase
   - The U.S. hyper-commercialized system of college sports, which does not exist anywhere else in the world, has generated billions of revenue over the years.  Division I athletics generated $15.8 billion in revenues in 2019, according to the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), which regulates student athletics among 1,100 colleges and universities. Power Five conferences combined for more than $3.3 billion in total revenue during the 2022 fiscal year. The Big Ten led the pack at $845.6 million. The Big Ten's reported revenue eclipsed the SEC by more than $40 million, the latter reporting in February that it generated $802 million in revenue for 2022.

    
## 3. Conflict
With all the revenue generated by student athletes, is it possible to distribute revenue to better compensate the athletes?

1) Athlete expenses surpass revenue

> Viz: 1) stream chart showing the revenue generated by divisions; 2) Table showing the net revenue; 3) FBS football net revenue by school

   - Net revenue of sports : Only a select share of Division I college athletes produce billions of dollars of revenue every year for their schools. Almost all of this revenue comes from football and men’s basketball. Expenditures by college athletics departments are such that, with the exception of a small number of schools, athletic expenses surpass revenues at the overwhelming majority of Division I programs. In 2019, only 25 of 130 schools in the high-grossing Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) whose members are large, mostly public universities (with some exceptions such as Notre Dame, Northwestern, and Stanford) reported positive net revenues.

3) Intensified scrutiny over NCAA: Redistributing expenses
> Viz: Expense of football and men's basketball take up xx percent of the total expenses;
> Viz: Show the number of the medium salary of Division One Football: > $3.5 million. (rawgraph: stream graph to show football and men's basketball)
   - The employment status and fair compensation of college athletes are being discussed in state legislatures, U.S. Congress, federal agencies—such as the National Labor Relations Board—and federal courts. As scrutiny intensifies on the NCAA, the Power Five conferences and the Division I schools, there is an ever-increasing need for transparency and accuracy regarding where money is generated, how it is spent and on whom, focusing on non-revenue sports. 


## 4. Solution
> Viz: the timeline of legalizing NIL Deals.
Why Legalizing is important for athletes?
- Athletes can take the initiative to earn their own money, not only for athletes playing football or basketball, but also those from less popular sports. They could draw more attention to the sport and live a better life.
- Athletes usually have a shorter professional life, it is crucial that they take advantage of their years in college.

## 5. Call to Action: Nation-level regulation on NIL Deals
> Viz: the map of the states that has legalized NIL Deals in NCAA

## What I did to the dataset (3-4h)
- the actual processing does not take long, but figuring out the right form of data that fits the visualization tools is very time-consuming. EADA does not provide combined dataset. It also labels the year of dataset differently which is very confusing. In addition to that, there are two links for each year's data. The total numbers supposed to be the same but they are not. It took me a lot time to figure out which is the right one. 
1. combining data from 2016-2021
2. filter out the NCAA from all classifications
3. select out the features I want (revenue, expense, count)
4. aggregation, calculation, modifying the data to fit the visualization tools


# User research 

## Target audience
### Anyone who is interested in NCAA

| The ideas of the visualization worked well, but still need to modify some details | I will do this in the end, when I finish building my website and inserting all the background images, to make sure that the colors is consistent. |
| NIL deals itself is straightforward, but I should provide more information for those who are interested in how it is legalized and how it works with state-level regulations. | Adding some explanations in the solution part, also add links to some articles that explain the logic more extensively.  |
| No data visualization in the 60s story | adding revenue charts and expenses of football into the first part |
