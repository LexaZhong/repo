# 1. Summary
In order to equally provide financial supports to all college sports NCAA(National Collegiate Athletic Association), EADA (Equity Athlete Data Analysis) requires colleges and universities to provide an annual report that documents if a school that receives federal money treats college athletes equally. However, profittable sports like football requires a far higher budget, which conflicts with the equity in sports. This problem can be solved by legalizing NIL deals (Name, Image, and Likeness), turning student athletes into employees and letting them earn their own money.


# 2. Project Structure
## 1) **What should the readers understand?**
- Background
  - As a reader, I want to know if athletes in NCAA(National Collegiate Athletic Assiciation) are properly and equally compensated.The employment status and fair compensation of college athletes are being discussed in state legislatures, U.S. Congress, federal agencies—such as the National Labor Relations Board—and federal courts. As scrutiny intensifies on the NCAA, the Power Five conferences and the Division I schools, there is an ever-increasing need for transparency and accuracy regarding where money is generated, how it is spent and on whom.
  - So far, the only public and reliable data source is the EADA (Equity Athlete Data Analysis) reports. The EADA requires colleges and universities to provide an annual report that documents how money is allocated to men’s and women’s teams, to show if a school that receives federal money treats college athletes equally. the EADA has served the public good by providing a much-needed window into the broad financial inner workings of college sport programs, and it has served its consumer protection purpose in its simplicity. (According to the data, in general, the revenue for college sports seem really good and the gender gap in financial support for sports has been narrowing throughout the years.) But does the data show the whole picture?
- Conflict
  - In the history of college sports, whether to publicly disclose the financial data has been controversial. Many athletic directors has opposed to sharing revenue with college athletes, which they think threatens the college athletics financial model and would lead to significant cuts to non-revenue sports, which are all the sports besides men's basketball and football. They also criticized the EADA, saying it is potentially offering an inflated view of what revenue can be shared because it does not include net revenue. 
  - Since the budget for football is skyrocketing, is there a solution that could equally distribute the funds across sports and still statisfy the large amount of money needed to run the most profittable college sports? Yes.
- Problem and Solution
  - One possible solution is to allow college athletes to receive compensation for their NIL (Name, Image, and Likeness). In the United States, college sports are rising in popularity, generating revenues of over $1 billion year after year. Despite this popularity, collegiate athletes have long been prohibited from receiving compensation for their name, image, and likeness (NIL). This rule, however, has been debated for decades. To answer this question, a series of recent court cases have begun to lean towards the student athletes. In addition, state legislatures were shaping the debates by legalizing NIL payments to players. Less than 12 hours before implementation of state laws designed to challenge the NCAA’s NIL rules, the NCAA updated its NIL policy, allowing collegiate athletes across the country to capitalize off their NIL.6 This policy change is widely viewed as one of the most significant changes in the Association’s 115-year history.
  - Despite the spread of NIL deals in its first few years, clear rules of the road have not been established. Each state has a different standard for compensation, healthcare, and revenue sharing, among other policy decisions that are getting wrapped into NIL policy, which has left athletes, universities, and conferences confused.  

## 2) **Identify my Call to Action**
  - Congress is playing a crucial role in setting up the rules for economic actions, it is really important to set up country-level standard for NIL deals.

# 4. data source
## 1) How to use the data
  - The Equity in Athletics Data Analysis is conducted by the Office of Postsecondary Education of the U.S. Department of Education. This analysis cutting tool was designed to provide rapid customized reports for public inquiries relating to equity in athletics data. The data are drawn from the OPE Equity in Athletics Disclosure Website database. This database consists of athletics data that are submitted annually as required by the Equity in Athletics Disclosure Act (EADA), via a Web-based data collection, by all co-educational postsecondary institutions that receive Title IV funding (i.e., those that participate in federal student aid programs) and that have an intercollegiate athletics program. I will use this data to display the revenue of college sports across schools, gender, and schools.
